  <h1>How to use Vector Control Academy</h1>

  <h2>1. Accounts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use a valid email address and your Discord tag when registering.</li>
    <li>Admins can promote users to mentors from the Admin dashboard.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Training flow</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Join the waiting list for <strong>Module 1</strong>.</li>
    <li>A mentor accepts you from the queue and conducts sessions.</li>
    <li>After the mentor marks a module as <strong>completed</strong>, you may queue for the next one.</li>
    <li>Failing Module 1 or 2 resets all progress – you must start again from Module 1.</li>
    <li>After all four modules are completed, you can request your Vector Control Academy rating.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>3. Mentors</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Mentors can pick trainees from queues and update module status (waiting / completed / failed).</li>
    <li>Mentors and admins can create detailed <strong>session reports</strong> with subject, topic, comment and grade.</li>
    <li>Mentors cannot remove other mentors from a trainee – only admins can kick from the queue.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Support & communication</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the <strong>Support</strong> page to open a ticket and chat with staff.</li>
    <li>Tickets can be closed by the creator, mentors or admins when the issue is resolved.</li>
